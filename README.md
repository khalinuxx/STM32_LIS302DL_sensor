# STM32F4 accelerometer sensor
Learning and testing various sensors of [STM32DISCOVERYF4](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html) 
**This project is to make use 1 sensor devices.**

## LIS302DL: 3-axis accelerometer
The **LIS302DL** is an ultra compact low-power three axes linear accelerometer. It includes a sensing element and an IC interface able to provide the measured acceleration to the external world through I2C/SPI serial interface.
